# Retail Probabilistic ML model for revenue based on Google Analytics data

This is a step-by-step data analysis and machine learning project to develop a model that can predict the probability of generating revenue (online shopping) based on users' actions as per Google Analytics data.

The first part involves an EDA and preprocessing process to determine the best approach to building the ML model. Then, I performed features selection and test three types of ML algoritms models, comparing their performance and selecting the best one.
