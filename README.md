# Retail Probabilistic ML model for revenue based on Google Analytics data

This is a step-by-step data analysis and machine learning project to develop a model that can predict the probability of generating revenue (online shopping) based on users' actions as per Google Analytics data.

The first part involves a data cleaning and analysis process to determine the best approach to building the ML model. Then, I test three types of ML algoritms models and compare their performance.
